  Creating a user requires a single insert (into users) if the role record with the given
  role_name already exists in the db, or two inserts (into roles and then into users)
  if the given role_name does not exist yet.

  When an operation like creating a user involves inserts to several tables,
  we want the operation to succeed or fail as a whole. It would not do to
  insert a new role record and then have the insertion of the user fail.

  In situations like these we use transactions: if anything inside the transaction
  fails, all the database changes in it are rolled back.
